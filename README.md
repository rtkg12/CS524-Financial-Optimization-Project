CS524-Financial-Optimization-Project

Portfolio optimization final project for CS 524 at UW Madison. We will be building a fundamental analysis model using historical fundamental data for stocks listed on the NYSE. After this, we will build an optimal portfolio using Markowitz's Modern Portfolio theory and a tradeoff with our calculated valuation of a stock.
