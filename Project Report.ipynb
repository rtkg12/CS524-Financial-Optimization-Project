    "\n",
    "This project attempts to accomplish two main tasks. First, an absolute equity (stock) valuation model is to be developed that receives fundamental data of a company as parameters and returns the value of the company. The value returned by the model is assumed to be the intrinsic value of the company. This value can be compared to the market capitalization (or market value - as determined by the company’s stock price and number of outstanding shares) to determine if the stock is under, over, or fair-valued. Second, an optimal portfolio is to be developed using both the Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory and the valuation determined by the previous model. Both long (buying securities) and short (selling securities by borrowing shares) optimal portfolios are discussed and explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately \\$169 billion dollars of stocks are traded daily on the [New York Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange).  The overall value of the companies traded in the U.S. stock market is $34 trillion. This equates to [roughly 43% of the value of all publicly traded companies in the world](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-stock-market-is-biggest-most-expensive-in-world-but-us-economy-is-not-the-most-productive-cm942558). Millions of investors look to buy (sell) companies that they feel are undervalued (overvalued) so that they may sell (cover) their position at some later date for a profit. To do this, traders must analyze thousands of stocks based on what the expected risks and returns, which can be done many different ways. One such way, which will be examine in this project, is by combining the [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), introduced by economist Harry Markowitz, with [Fundamental Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis) of the underlying factors that affect a stock's price, a method widely advocated by investing juggernauts like [Benjamin Graham](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/ben_graham.asp) and [Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/university/warren-buffett-biography/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benjamin Graham, and his famed prodigy Warren Buffett, have forged their investment principles by leveraging fundamental characteristics (among a few other ideas) of a company to determine its actual value. [Fundamental data](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/022603.asp) is any data that is expected to affect the perceived value of an equity. Examples of fundamental data include: cash flow, return on assets, earnings, debt levels, and many more. In total, there were 74 fundamental metrics used to develop the equity valuation model described in this report. In this project, 1,230 samples were collected from years 2012 to 2016. Each of these samples are sourced from Form 10-K SEC filings that companies must submit to shareholders on a yearly basis.  This dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle), an open source data science community, from which both [fundamental analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse#fundamentals.csv) and [stock price](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse#prices-split-adjusted.csv) data is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry Markowitz developed what is now known as [Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) that was first published in The Journal of Finance in 1952. The model has various assumptions not discussed in this report, but is rooted in the idea that choosing a group of investment equities which collectively have lower risk than any single equity will have on its on its own. Depending on investment goals, a tradeoff between the expected returns of a portfolio and the risk of the associated portfolio can be explored. An optimal portfolio lies on the Pareto frontier of [expected returns and expected portfolio risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/markowitzefficientset.asp). In this project, we explore the addition of a third tradeoff term to determine an optimal portfolio. This additional term is the amount undervalued (or overvalued) of an equity as determined by our equity valuation model. We explore different trade-offs to reflect different investment styles in this report.\n",

    "## 3. Solution ##\n",
    "\n",
    "To expand on the possibilities for an optimal portfolio, we decided to construct both an optimal long position portfolio as well as an optimal short position portfolio. A fund manager may desire to allocate a portfolio to only short-positions to hedge themselves against their long positions and/or possible economic factors like a recession that might pull many of the stocks in the market lower. The traditional “buy-and-hold” investor may find that the long-only optimal portfolio is better suited for their needs. In addition, the short portfolio is neglecting some important as\f",
    "\n",
    "pects of borrowing shares including: borrowing rates, availability of shares to borrow, potential margin calls, etc. The potential loss on a short investment is theoretically unbounded, but we do not discuss these assumptions and technicalities in this report. An investor looking to short securities in practice would need to obtain a deeper understanding of the subject before attempting any endeavor. \n",
    "\tThe Equity Valuation Model is first constructed, since its results will be used in the Markowitz Optimal Portfolio models. It was desired by our group to obtain solutions that were “real”, so only real market data was used throughout the analysis. To build the Equity Valuation Model, we used 5 years worth of data (1,230 samples) to essentially train our LS Regression Model. By using the optimal weights for each fundamental characteristic, we are then able to estimate the value of a company by applying the weights to the fundamental data of any given company. Since the market capitalization is always known for each stock (market capitalization = # shares outstanding * share price), we can compare the estimated value from our model with the current market capitalization to determine if an equity is currently under/over or fair-valued. However, since the price of companies can vary widely, it was necessary that we looked at a relative measure of value difference instead of an absolute one. This meant looking at the percent difference of our expected price and the current price instead of simply taking the difference. Once we obtained a vector of calculated percent differences, we could then insert this information into the Markowitz Optimal Portfolio models.\n",
    "\tWhen considering an optimal portfolio for long positions, we concerned our model with three different objectives: maximize expected returns, minimize risk, and maximizing the percent undervalued that a company is as determined by the previous model. It became necessary to model the objective function as a tradeoff between these three terms since all of them could not be solved to their absolute optimum simultaneously. Later in the report we will explore how different tradeoffs affect optimal portfolio composition as well as performance. Daily expected return data was collected for 306 equites and a covariance matrix of these equities was constructed. After having all pieces for the objective needed, we looked at reasonable constraints for the model. To ensure at least some diversification, we did not allow that more than 50% of the portfolio to be invested in any one stock. We also enforced that the entire portfolio be allocated completely. The long and short portfolios were constructed identically with the exception of desiring to maximize the percent overvalued that a stock is in the objective function.\n",
    "\tTo access the accuracy of our models, a test set of the 306 equities was gathered from the year 2014. A validation set was constructed with the same 306 equites for the year 2015. Optimal long and short portfolios were then constructed using the test set. Under the assumption that the portfolio was held for a year, we analyzed the results using the validation set.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization project explores the task of attempting to accurately value a company’s stock, and then use that valuation in a Markowitz portfolio in attempts to generate portfolios that will have superior returns coupled with reasonable risk. Given that many investors have different appetites for potential risks and possible rewards, we have provided a trade off curve and a trade off surface to explore the interaction between multiple objectives: maximizing expected returns, minimizing risk, and maximizing the amount that a company is undervalued (Minimize all objectives for short portfolio). The project uses real data so that the derived results may be more significant and applicable in practice. In the future, we would like to have access to more data and from multiple time periods to increase the robustness of the proposed models. It may be possible to explore the plausibility of using different models during different market conditions, but these are just a few of the possible extensions to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project shows how optimization can be applied to financial markets and business valuation. We realize that many large corporations likely use much more sophisticated models than the ones proposed in this report; however, we believe that these models are adequate at introducing the lay-investor to optimization in finance and also do a fine job at accomplishing the objectives that we had laid out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: The models and discussion in this report is not to be taken as investment advice. Use of this model in practice may lead to substantial losses in which our group is not responsible for. The models only exist for theoretical exploration and all conjecture is purely academic.
